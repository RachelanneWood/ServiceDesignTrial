# ServiceDesignTrial
A Service Design Trial by Rachel A.Wood


Phython Code file:
How It Works
1. Database Connection:
• Creates or connects to a local SQLite database file named service_design.db.
2. Table Creation:
• Sets up a table service_design_methods with columns for an auto-incrementing id, the method_name, its associated phase, and a short description.
3. Data Insertion:
• Demonstrates how to insert example rows covering each Double Diamond phase:
• Discovery – Methods for user research and stakeholder analysis
• Define – Methods for framing and prioritizing insights
• Development – Methods for prototyping and refining solutions
• Delivery – Methods for implementing and launching solutions
• Evaluate – Methods for assessing impact and learning
4. Queries:
• Shows how to retrieve methods associated with a single phase (e.g., “Discovery”) and how to list all methods grouped by phase.
5. Customization:
• Add more columns (e.g., recommended duration, team roles, complexity) if needed.
• Use additional tables or foreign keys if you want to link each method to resources, templates, or deeper documentation.

This structure provides a simple but extensible foundation for a service design “toolbox” aligned with the Double Diamond process. You can build upon it to include more sophisticated features such as user authentication, version control for methods, or web-based interfaces for easier data entry and retrieval.
